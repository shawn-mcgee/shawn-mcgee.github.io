I have spent the last few months in somewhat of a developer crisis.

I began programming in middle school when I checked out a book on ActionScript 
from the library and obtained a free trial of AdobeFlash to experiment with.






In order to become a web developer, one must become a 
[Polyglot](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/polyglot) Programmer. 

The internet is overflowing with developer videos, blogs, and tutorials that 
promise the quickest, easiest, most elegant, most correct way of solving 
problems or achieving success. In my experience, I find there exist truly 
useful insights, but to gather each into your arms like the dime-a-dozen 
dandelions they are does not a problem solve.

That is to say, each insight is a valuable tool in its own regard, but 

That is to say, the true work of a developer is solving problems


In order to be a web developer one must become a Polyglot Programmer, because
the web itself exists within an undulating, multilingual liminal space. 
Browsers, Bundlers, Compilers, and Transpilers alike play a roll in TheStack.

Languages like C, C++, C#, Go, Dart, Flutter, HTML, JS, CSS



I have tried (and failed) to use other static site generators like 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).




### Getting Started

I'm going to assume some degree of familiarity with Node.js

```powershell
npm install -D @11ty/eleventy
```

Let's start with 


*index.md:*
```md
This is a file
```





### Adding Syntax Highlighting with Prism.js

As a developer it is
Eleventy provides an official plugin

### Adding Tailwind Style and Typography

```powershell
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography
```

```powershell
npx tailwindcss init
```

*tailwind.config.js:*
```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  // This regular expression targets 
  content: ["/_site/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: { },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
}
```

*package.json:*
```json
{
  "script": {
    "build": "eleventy && tailwindcss -i _site/style.css -o _site/style.css"
  }
}
```

*eleventy.js:*
```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("./**/*.css")
}
```
