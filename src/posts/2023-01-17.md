I have opted to style this blog using the infamous 
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) along with 
[prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting.






In honor of those programmers who came before me I offer a simple rendition of
`Hello World` written in the language with which I first fell in love.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!")
  }
}
```
