As a freelance developer, one piece of advice I often receive is simply to "write". I have tried and failed many times to start a blog and the one thing that always seems to stand in my way is the simple fact that *writing is hard*. Or to be more specific that *good writing is hard*.

For lack of a better term, what I am going to refer to as "Developer Culture", exerts tremendous pressure on individuals to overshare via blogs, newsletters, tweets (xeets?), videos, podcasts, et cetera.

<!-- Pressure to write about what you are working on, but how can I write about it when I don't know enough about it. The point of projects is to learn and there is little value (IMO) in sharing my ignorance for fear that I lead myself and/or someone else astray. -->

<!-- This blog will have no regular posts. Posts will be of any length, not padded with fluff to make you read more ads (which there are none). I'm not here to toot my own horn. Why there is something useful to say I will say it. -->
